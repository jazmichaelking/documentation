## Choosing a website {#picker}

To get started on Mastodon you will first choose a website to sign up on, like you would choose an e-mail provider. The website you choose will be your service provider; hosting your account, your profile, and your home feed.

You can [browse a list of servers by categories and languages on joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org/#getting-started).

### Understanding a website's policies {#tos}

Before you sign up for a service, it is important to understand its policies and terms of use. A Mastodon website will usually have its policies listed publicly, which can be found by clicking "learn more" on the landing page.

### Signup modes {#signup}

Mastodon allows website administrators to set one of three different signup modes: open signups, server invites, and approval mode.

#### Open signup {#open}

Allows you to register immediately -- simply fill out the signup form with your username, email address, and password, and you can start using your account.

#### Server invites {#invite}

Requires invite links to be generated and shared in order to allow people to sign up.

#### Approval-based signup {#approval}

Similar to open signup, but once you submit the form, your account must be approved by a moderator before you can start using it.

## Your username and your domain {#address}

Mastodon usernames consist of two parts:

* The local username, e.g. `alice`
* And the domain of the website, e.g. `example.com`

Just like an e-mail address. For convenience, Mastodon allows you to skip the second part when addressing people on the same server as you, but you have to keep in mind when sharing your username with other people, you need to include the domain or they won’t be able to find you as easily.

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| I’m @alice on Mastodon! | Wrong |
| I’m @alice@example.com on Mastodon! | Correct |
| I'm https://example.com/@alice on Mastodon! | Correct |

The search form in Mastodon will find people either with the above address form, or the link to the person’s profile, so you can share that instead if you prefer.

The same username _can_ be registered on different servers -- there is no way to claim all of them ahead of time. Just like with e-mail, you should not expect `alice@outlook.com` to be the same person as `alice@gmail.com` or `alice@yahoo.com`.
